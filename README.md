__An Interactive Storytelling-Based Platform for Learning C++ Programming__

## Project Overview

The project aims to design and develop an interactive digital learning platform that teaches C++ programming fundamentals through storytelling, task-based interaction, and chatbot-assisted guidance.
The core idea of the project is to move away from traditional text-heavy programming lessons and instead provide learners with a narrative-driven learning experience, where each C++ concept is presented as a story mission. Learners progress through chapters by solving coding challenges such as fill-in-the-blank tasks, logic-based decision making, debugging activities, output predictions, and code simulations.
To further support learners during the learning process, the platform integrates a context-aware chatbot that acts as a virtual tutor. The chatbot provides hints, concept explanations, and debugging guidance when learners are stuck, without directly revealing answers. This ensures continuous engagement while maintaining the learning challenge.
The platform is targeted at beginners and undergraduate students who often find C++ difficult due to complex syntax and abstract concepts. By integrating instructional design principles, gamification, interactive problem-solving, and chatbot-based support, the platform aims to improve learner engagement, conceptual understanding, and learning motivation.

## Project Goals

    • To apply instructional design principles to programming education.
    • To create an engaging, interactive, and learner-centered experience for C++ beginners.
    • To improve conceptual understanding of C++ through story-based problem solving and simulations.
    • To provide timely feedback, hints, and guidance through an integrated chatbot system.
    • To ensure accessibility, usability, and inclusivity for diverse learners.

## Key Features

    • Story-based learning modules aligned with core C++ topics
    • Interactive coding tasks, quizzes, and debugging challenges
    • Chatbot-assisted guidance for hints, explanations, and debugging support
    • Instant feedback with retry and hint mechanisms
    • Level-based progression, badges, and gamification elements
    • Visual simulation of C++ logic and memory behavior
    • Beginner-friendly, accessible, and responsive user interface

## Instructional Design Approach

The project follows core Instructional Design principles, including:
    • Clearly defined learning objectives for each story chapter
    • Chunking content into small, manageable, level-based modules
    • Learning by doing through interactive coding tasks and problem-solving
    • Immediate feedback and reinforcement to support mastery
    • Motivation through storytelling, rewards, and chatbot-based guidance
